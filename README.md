# NS-SHAFT & NS-TOWER in GlovePIE

This is a very simple script for GlovePIE to play NS-SHAFT or NS-TOWER.  

I don't think using GlovePIE is a good solution to play NS-SHAFT/NS-TOWER, because the software itself is hard to find nowadays, and It's just too hard for everyone to connect or pair Wiimotes to computer, but here's the solution if you have to.  

[Touchmote](http://touchmote.net/) is better, faster and skill friendly for everyone, you can connect wiimotes ane configure controls much easier.

## Installation

Connect your Wiimotes to computer via bluetooth, and download the .PIE file and open with GlovePIE, press START to activate.

## [NS-SHAFT](https://www.nagi-p.com/v1/nssh.html) controls

Wiimote B = Space (Confirm)  
Wiimote Rotate Clockwise = Right(X)  
Wiimote Rotate Anti-Clockwise = Left(Z)  
Player 1 and Player 2 are much the same.  

## [NS-TOWER](https://www.nagi-p.com/v1/nstw.html) controls

Wiimote A = Space (Jump)  
Wiimote B = Space (Confirm)
